    Slightly improved customer AI:
        -Now will not pay more than double for what it cost you, and only 1% of them
            will pay that. This makes the limit on profit 1%, with a lot of lost customers.
            Balance profits/costs/satisfaction wisely

Alpha 0.1:
    Absolute basics:
        -Buying/selling items
        -Customers buy everything on their list that you have, no questions asked
        -Adjusting prices of stock

    No saving/loading and customers have a zombie AI
